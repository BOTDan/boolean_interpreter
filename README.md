# Boolean Algebra Interpreter
## What is it?
This code is capable of taking a string of boolean algebra and doing various things with it:
	- Producing an output given a set of input variables
	- Producing a truth table
	- Comparing if 2 expressions are the same.
## How do I use it?
1. Download this repository and unpack it somewhere.
2. Run the `main.py` file. This can probably be done by double-clicking the file if you have Python installed.

Available commands are `table`, `eval`, `same`, `simplify` and `ui`.
