# Boolean Algebra Interpreter
## What is it?
This code is capable of taking a string of boolean algebra and doing various things with it:
	- Producing an output given a set of input variables
	- Producing a truth table
	- Comparing if 2 expressions are the same.
## How do I use it?
1. Download this repository and unpack it somewhere.
2. Open a command prompt where you unpacked the files.
3. Use the command `python main.py`. You need python added to your system PATH for this to work.
	- You could also open main.py in *IDLE* or *Pyzo* and run it from there.

Available commands are `eval`, `compare` and `table`.
