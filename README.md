# Boolean Algebra Interpreter
## What is it?
This code is capable of taking a string of boolean algebra and doing various things with it:
- Producing an output given a set of input variables
- Producing a truth table
- Comparing if 2 expressions are the same.

It also has a UI that allows you to build circuits and generate a boolean algebra representation. The UI comes with a few demonstration circuits, which can be found in the circuits folder of the repo.
## How do I use it?
1. Download this repository and unpack it somewhere.
2. Run the `main.py` file. This can probably be done by double-clicking the file if you have Python installed.
